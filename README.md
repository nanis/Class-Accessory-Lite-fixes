# Class::Accessor::Lite fixes

Repo for working on
[Class::Accessor::Lite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Class::Accessor::Lite).

I noticed that the module had some spurious test failures due to hard coded
directory separators. I wanted to submit a pull request, but noticed there
was repo listed. So, here is my working repo for generating patches.

This is not the official repository for `Class::Accessor::Lite`. It may end
up lagging behind official releases of the module. For your own use, install
the module from CPAN.
